<h1>Puzzle Plane</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

You wake up in a dark room. After some investigation, you find a lone lamp. As you approach it, you are sucked into the lamp and brought to a different world where you are piloting a spaceship through an asteroid field. You shoot all the asteroids, clear away the debris, and get pulled out the lamp. The lamp shines brightly revealing you are in a puzzle piece.

You continue investigating items and beating the challenges that arise. You slowly come to the realization that you are in a dream state and are unlocking tiles of your bedroom. Once all the tiles are unlocked and your bedroom is back to normal, you can go to sleep and escape the puzzle plane.
